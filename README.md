# Angular 2 Seed Project

A minimal Angular 2 starter project which TypeScript, Gulp and SystemJS Loader. Also this is a good seed project to get your hands dirty with asynchronous programming. 

I made this project by combining following two code samples.

1. [A minimal Angular2 playground using TypeScript and SystemJS loader](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play)
2. [Taking advantage of Observables in Angular 2](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/01/06/taking-advantage-of-observables-in-angular2.html)
